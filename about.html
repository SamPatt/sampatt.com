        		<h1>About</h1>
          <p>I'm Sam.</p>
		  <p>I'm a co-founder of OB1, a company which leads development of OpenBazaar. OpenBazaar is a decentralized marketplace where people can engage in free trade without needing to ask permission from anyone.</p>
		  <p>I wrote one of the first books about Bitcoin in early 2013, and have been an advocate ever since.</p>
		  <p>I do voiceover work on the side, click the voiceover link above to see my work.</p>
		  <p>I worked in Washington D.C. for four years as a policy analyst, mostly on technology policy. My ideological views are solidly in support of individual rights and freedoms and are unabashedly pro-humanity. Books like "The Rational Optimist" by Matt Ridley, "Englightenment Now" by Steven Pinker, and (slightly less so) "Stubborn Attachments" by Tyler Cowen are closest to my thinking.</p>
		  <p>I have a few hobbies such as ham radio and creating data visualizations. I sometimes blog about them.</p>
