        		<h1>About</h1>
          <p>I'm Sam.</p>
		  <p>Back in 2013 I wrote a short book about Bitcoin, and have been an advocate ever since.</p>
		  <p>I co-founded OB1, a company which lead development of OpenBazaar. OpenBazaar was a decentralized marketplace where people could engage in free trade without needing to ask permission from anyone. The company and project failed in 2020, though the open source code lives on.</p>
		  <p>Voiceover work is a fun side venture, click the voiceover link above to see my work.</p>
		  <p>I worked in Washington D.C. as a policy analyst, mostly on technology policy. My ideological views are solidly in support of individual rights and freedoms and are unabashedly pro-humanity. Books like "The Rational Optimist" by Matt Ridley, "Englightenment Now" by Steven Pinker, and "Stubborn Attachments" by Tyler Cowen are closest to my thinking.</p>
		  <p>There are many hobbies I enjoy, such as ham radio, macro photography, writing, and programming. I sometimes blog about them.</p>
		  <p>Reading is a way of life. I'm a lifelong learner.</p>
		  <p>Fitness has become important to me, and I now regularly participate in long distance cycling and other outdoor activities.</p>
		  <p>I enjoy talking with interesting people about interesting subjects. If you're one of those people, <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
