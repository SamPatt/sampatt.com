content: Well said. Way to take this up as a "teachable moment." It amazed me already
  nearly two years ago that there were so many people willing to talk about this subject
  without learning much at all first. Now? It's ever harder to construct an excuse
  given the volume of quality material now out there just for the cost of googling
  it. At least start with the white paper!

  both of your parents, but not well - still, they were the kind of people who made
  an immediate impression because of the luminous way they carried themselves, &amp;
  how their belief in our Almighty Creator&amp;the salvation offered through His Son
  was SO evident in their lives. Thank you so much.\r\nKathie - Hornell New York"
