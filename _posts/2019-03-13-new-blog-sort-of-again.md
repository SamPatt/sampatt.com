title: New blog, sort of, again
---

I've switched my blog over from an old Wordpress install to this new sampatt.com domain which is a static build.

If you read through the old posts you'll note that they probably have some formatting errors and are missing pictures. I might go through and fix them eventually.

As before, this site exists primarily for people to find information about me, contact me, etc. I don't plan on the blog being frequently updated or widely read.

However, there are occasionally times I'd like to put my thoughts on public display, or announce updates about projects I'm working on. So, here's the blog.
